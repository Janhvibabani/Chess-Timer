## Introduction

`Chess Timer` is a web‑based chess clock that lets players set game duration, increment, and choose between horizontal or vertical layouts. It offers several visual themes and runs entirely in the browser, making it easy to start a timed game without installing any software.

- **Language**: TypeScript  
- **UI Library**: React 19  
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 3  
- **Icons**: lucide‑react  
- **Build Tools**: Turbopack (via `next dev`), ESLint, PostCSS  

## Prerequisites / Requirements

- **Node.js** (>= 18)  
- **npm**, **pnpm**, or **yarn**  
- Internet connection for fetching dependencies  

## Installation

1. Clone the repository  

   ```bash

## Project Structure

- `app/` – Main application code (pages, components, layout)  
  - `components/` – Reusable UI components (e.g., `CustomDropdown.tsx`)  
  - `page.tsx` – Home page containing the timer setup UI  
  - `layout.tsx` – Root layout for the Next.js app  
- `public/` – Static assets (fonts, images)  
- `styles/` or `globals.css` – Global Tailwind CSS configuration  
- `package.json` – Project metadata and scripts  
- `tsconfig.json` – TypeScript compiler options  

## Features

- Set player names, game duration, and increment  
- Choose between horizontal and vertical board layouts  
- Select from multiple visual themes (Classic, Cream, Pastel)  
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS  
- Fully client‑side; no backend required  

## Development

- **Linting**: `npm run lint` (uses ESLint with Next.js preset)  
- **Type‑checking**: Integrated via the TypeScript compiler (`tsc --noEmit`)  
- **Hot Reload**: Enabled by default in development mode (`next dev`)
